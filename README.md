# ðŸ©º Medibox

## Overview

Medibox is a smart medication reminder system built using an ESP32 microcontroller. It helps users manage their medication schedule by setting alarms, monitoring environmental conditions, and displaying relevant information on an OLED screen.

## Features

- **Alarm System**: Set up to three customizable alarms to remind users to take their medication.
- **NTP Time Synchronization**: Automatically synchronizes time using an NTP server to ensure accuracy.
- **OLED Display**: Provides a simple interface for setting alarms, checking the time, and viewing notifications.
- **Temperature and Humidity Monitoring**: Continuously monitors the environment and alerts users if the conditions are outside the desired range.
- **Buzzer and LED Alerts**: Audible and visual notifications to ensure alarms and warnings are noticed.
- **User-Friendly Menu Navigation**: Easy-to-use buttons allow for navigating the menu, setting alarms, and configuring time zones.

## Getting Started

1. **Hardware Setup**: 
   - Assemble the Medibox by connecting the OLED display, DHT22 sensor, buzzer, LEDs, and push buttons to the ESP32. Ensure all components are correctly connected and powered.

2. **Software Setup**:
   - Install the necessary libraries such as Adafruit GFX, Adafruit SSD1306, and DHT Sensor.
   - Clone the repository and upload the code to your ESP32 using your preferred IDE.

3. **Wi-Fi Configuration**:
   - Ensure the device is connected to a Wi-Fi network for time synchronization.

## Usage

1. **Set Time Zone**:
   - Navigate through the menu to set your local time zone.

2. **Set Alarms**:
   - Set up to three alarms to remind you when it's time to take your medication.

3. **Environmental Monitoring**:
   - The Medibox will automatically monitor the temperature and humidity, providing alerts if conditions are not ideal.

# ðŸ©º Advanced Medibox

## Overview

The Advanced Medibox is designed to enhance the functionality of a medication management device. This version of Medibox integrates light intensity monitoring, dynamic light adjustment, and user-configurable settings to ensure optimal storage conditions for sensitive medicines. 

## Features

- **Light Intensity Monitoring**:
  - Utilizes two Light Dependent Resistors (LDRs) placed on either side of the Medibox.
  - Measures and displays the highest light intensity from the two LDRs on the Node-RED dashboard.
  - Includes a gauge for real-time highest intensity and a plot to visualize past variations.
  - Indicates which LDR (left or right) has the highest intensity.

- **Dynamic Light Adjustment**:
  - A shaded sliding window controlled by a servo motor adjusts the light intensity entering the Medibox.
  - Motor angle adjustment based on light intensity using the following formula:
    \[
    \theta = \min\{ \theta_{\text{offset}} \times D + (180 - \theta_{\text{offset}}) \times I \times \gamma, 180 \}
    \]
    Where:
    - \(\theta\) is the motor angle.
    - \(\theta_{\text{offset}}\) is the minimum angle (default: 30 degrees).
    - \(I\) is the light intensity (0 to 1).
    - \(\gamma\) is the controlling factor (default: 0.75).
    - \(D\) is 0.5 if the right LDR has max intensity, 1.5 if the left LDR has max intensity.

- **User-Configurable Settings**:
  - New group in the Node-RED dashboard to adjust the minimum angle and controlling factor.
  - Two slider controls:
    - **Minimum Angle Slider**: Ranges from 0 to 120 degrees.
    - **Controlling Factor Slider**: Ranges from 0 to 1.
  - Dropdown menu with options for commonly used medicines (e.g., Tablet A, B, C) and a custom option.
  - Custom option allows manual adjustment of minimum angle and controlling factor.
